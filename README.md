# EEx Formatter/Beautify

Most of solutions that exist on the Internet tell you to create a task and call it from the ctrl-shift-p menu.

This extension basically uses [htmlbeautifier](https://github.com/threedaymonk/htmlbeautifier) to format your file using the Formatter API from vscode, so no need to create a hack using Task, etc.

## Features

## Requirements

```
gem install htmlbeautifier
```

NOTE: Filenames with extension `.html.eex` might be recognized as an `html` file, not as an `eex` file. In that case, add a setting in your `settings.json` like below:

```json
"files.associations": {
  "*.eex": "eex"
}
```

## Settings
